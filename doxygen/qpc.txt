\section overview QP&trade; Overview


<a href="http://www.state-machine.com/qm/"><strong>QP&trade; (Quantum Platform)</strong></a> is a family of lightweight, open source software frameworks for building responsive and modular real-time embedded applications as systems of cooperating, event-driven <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/qp/index.php#Active">active objects</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actors</a>). The QP&trade; family consists of QP/C, QP/C++, and QP-nano frameworks, which are all strictly quality controlled, superbly documented, and commercially licensable.

All QP&trade; frameworks can run on "bare-metal" single-chip microcontrollers, completely replacing a traditional Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). Ports and ready-to-use examples are provided for most major <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/downloads/index.php#QDK">CPU families</a>. QP/C and QP/C++ can also work with a traditional OS/RTOS, such as: <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/linux/">POSIX (Linux, QNX)</a>, <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/win32/">Windows</a>, <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/android/">Android-NDK</a>, <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/threadx/">ThreadX</a>, <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/ucos2/">MicroC/OS</a>, <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/freertos/">FreeRTOS</a>, etc.

The behavior of active objects is specified in QP by means of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine">hierarchical state machines (UML statecharts)</a>. The frameworks support manual coding of UML state machines in C or C++ as well as fully automatic code generation by means of the free graphical <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/qm/">QM&trade; modeling tool</a>.

The QP frameworks are used in millions of products worldwide in aerospace, robotics, consumer electronics, wired and wireless telecommunications, industrial automation, transportation, and many more. The QP frameworks and the QM modeling tool receive over <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qpc/files/stats/timeline?dates=2012-08-28+to+2013-08-28">30,000 downloads a year</a> (not even counting downloads of QP ports).

QP is available for download from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qpc">SourceForge.net</a>--the world's biggest open source repository. The summary of available downloads is also available from <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/downloads">Quantum Leaps download page</a>.

\section tutor QP/C Tutorial

The \ref tutorial explains all steps necessary to develop a
non-trivial QP/C application. The Tutorial is based on Chapter 1 of
<I>Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, Second Edition</I>.

\section PSiCC2 Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, Second Edition

All versions of QP are described in detail in the book <I>Practical UML
Statecharts in C/C++, Second Edition: Event-Driven Programming for Embedded
Systems</I>, Newnes 2008 (ISBN-10: 0750687061, ISBN-13: 978-0750687065).

The book bridges the gap between high-level abstract concepts of the Unified
Modeling Language (UML) and the actual programming aspects of modern
hierarchical state machines (UML statecharts).

This book is presented in two parts. In Part I, you get a practical
description of the relevant state machine concepts starting from traditional
finite state automata to modern UML state machines followed by state machine
coding techniques with the %QEP hierarchical event processor as well as
several state-machine design patterns, all illustrated with executable
examples.

In Part II, you find a detailed design study of the %QF real-time framework,
%QK preemptive kernel, and %QS software tracing, which are indispensable for
combining concurrent, event-driven state machines into robust systems. In
addition to its value as a reference to the %QP event-driven platform, Part II
explains the key event-driven programming concepts such as inversion of control
("Hollywood Principle"), blocking versus non-blocking code, run-to-completion
(RTC) execution semantics, the importance of event queues, dealing with time,
and the role of state machines to maintain the context from one event to the
next. This background is designed to help software developers in making the
transition from the traditional sequential to the modern event-driven
programming, which can be one of the trickiest paradigm shifts.

\section licensing Licensing Policy for QP

All versions of the QP software are available under <A
HREF="http://www.state-machine.com/licensing/">dual licensing</A> model, in
which both the open source software distribution mechanism and traditional
closed source software licensing models are combined.

\subsection open Open Source Licensing

All versions of the QP software are available under the GNU General Public
License (GPL), as published by the Free Software Foundation and included in every
distribution of the QP software. The GPL license is probably the best known
and most established open source license. It is fully compatible with the Open
Source Definition, is endorsed by the Free Software Foundation, and has been
approved by the Open Source Initiative.

Please note that GPL applies to software based not upon how it is used but
upon how it is distributed. In this respect GPL2 can be restrictive, because
GPL version2 Section 2(b) requires that if you distribute the original software
or any derivative works based on the software under copyright law, you must release
all such derivative works also under the terms of the GPL open source
license. GPL clearly specifies that distributing the original software or any
derivative works based upon it in binary form (e.g., embedded inside devices)
also represents distribution of the software.

To read more about open source licensing for QP/C, QP/C++, or QP-nano,
please visit the following website:

- http://www.state-machine.com/licensing/open.php

or please contact Quantum Leaps, LLC via the following e-mail address:

- info@quantum-leaps.com


\subsection closed Closed Source Licensing

If you are developing and distributing traditional <b>closed source</b>
applications, you might purchase one of the Quantum Leaps commercial licenses,
which are specifically designed for users interested in retaining the
proprietary status of their code. This alternative licensing is possible,
because Quantum Leaps, LLC owns all intellectual property in the QP and
QP-nano software and as the copyright owner can license the software any
number of ways. The Quantum Leaps commercial licenses expressly supersede the
\ref gpl2_page open source license. This means that when you license the
software under a commercial license, you specifically do not use the software
under the open source license and therefore you are not subject to any of its
terms.

support, and to request a commercial license, please visit the following
